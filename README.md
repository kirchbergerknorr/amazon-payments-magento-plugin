## Quick Start - Login and Pay with Amazon for Magento

**Please note**: this is the U.S. version. It will most probably not work for shops in Europe.

[View the Complete User Guide](https://github.com/amzn/amazon-payments-magento-plugin/wiki)
or [Learn More about Amazon Payments] (https://payments.amazon.com/sp/magento)

### Pre-Requisites
* Magento CE 1.6+ or EE 1.11+.
    * Magento 1.5 is supported with a patch see [here](https://github.com/amzn/amazon-payments-magento-plugin/wiki/Community-and-FAQ#q-i-am-on-magento-ce-15-or-magento-ee-110-can-i-use-amazon-payments) for more information
* SSL is installed on your site and active on Checkout and Login pages
* Compilation is turned off in your Magento system


### Installation
> **NOTE** Before you begin, make a backup of your Magento site.

* Using Magento Connect (Recommended):
    * http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/pay-with-amazon-for-magento.html
* Using Manual Installation:
    * Click the Download Zip button and save to your local machine
    * Transfer the zip file to your Magento webserver
    * Unpack the archive in the root directory of your Magento instance
    * Flush your Magento caches
        * In the admin page for your Magento instance, navigate to System->Cache Management
        * Click the 'Flush Magento Cache'
        * More information on Magento Cache Management [here](http://www.magentocommerce.com/knowledge-base/entry/cache-storage-management)
    * Log out of the admin page and then log back in to ensure activation of the module

### Uninstall/Disable

   * From the command line edit the files: 
      ** `<magento_root>/app/etc/modules/Amazon_Login.xml` (in versions <= 1.3.1)
      ** `<magento_root>/app/etc/modules/Amazon_Payments.xml`
   * In each file, change the line
      `<active>true</active>`
      to
      `<active>false</active>`
   * This will completely disable the extension and prevent any resources being loaded by Magento.


### Configure Magento
* The plugin is configured under **System**->**Configuration**->**Payment Methods**->**Amazon Payments**.
* If you haven't already registered, use the link in the module to create an Amazon Payments account.
   * The new and improved registration system will automaticaly exchange your Amazon Payments account keys, provided you have SSL enabled for your admin. 
   * If you dont have SSL enabled, copy and paste the encrypted keys string and the end of the registration flow into the configuration and it will automatically set up your keys as well.

### v1.2 Release - Asynchronous Authorization
   * In the admin configuration, you enable Asynchronous mode by setting the 'Asynchronous Mode' to 'Yes' Now when buyers checkout, the call is asynchronous and the state returned from any Authorize call is 'Pending'
   * The system uses Magento's built-in cron job functionality to poll Amazon systems for the status of any Open orders. See http://www.magentocommerce.com/wiki/1_-_installation_and_configuration/how_to_setup_a_cron_job for more information.
   * NOTE Orders will never update to their correct status if you do not have cron enabled as specified in the Magento documentation.
   * The polling interval is 5 minutes and when the cron job executes, it will get the new status, update the order in Magento appropriately to your configured 'New Order Status' and, if Authorize and Capture is configured, create the Invoice in Magento.

#### When should you use async vs sync?

   * You should use async when you have large average order values, on the order of > $500-$1000
   * You might also consider using async to speed up checkout since the authorizations come back immediately with a 'Pending' status.
   * Only merchants who have an existing workflow for reaching out to customer's whose payment method was declined should use the asynchronous model.
